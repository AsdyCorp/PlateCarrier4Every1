Disclaimer:
This project aims to provide people (both civilians and volunteers) with protective equipment during current and future military conflicts and natural disasters. Calm times are not a given, please protect yourself and your loved ones. If possible, leave combat areas. As civilians, do not wear camouflage colors or military uniforms if you are in or near a combat zone. Use this plate carrier only if there are no alternative means of wearing armor. When using armor plates in a plate carrier, make sure their authenticity and degree of protection corresponds to protection from small arms and shrapnel. The author is not responsible for the life, health and property of you or your family and any possible damage.

Project requires basic sewing skills. Optional parts are required for the quick removal system and allow you to adjust the size of plate carrier without the need to remove it. Optional parts can be obtained from old clothes or bought in embroidery supplies stores, some parts are available for 3D printing - look at the stl files folder. Climbing carabiner can be replaced with any steel ring with diameter of 3+ cm and circular thickness of at least 0.4 cm - make sure it can handle 10 kg weight hanging from it. Ladder lock buckles and sliding buckles should have belt holes that are 3 to 5 cm wide. Without optional parts, plate carrier will rely on the knots - use strong knots that can be untied without destroying the handles. To increase the service life of the plate carrier, wrap the plate carrier with a thick layer of tape and fabric on all sides. Do not use the plate carrier if there is visible damage to the surface of the bag or ballistic plates are cracked or deformed.
